# Simple recon

Simple Recon is just a simple bash script to automate my recon process. I made it for my personal use but thought to share it with the community.

## Install and setup

- Install:

``` git clone https://github.com/Simplerecon```
``` chmod +x recon.sh```

- Setup the tools before running the script

``` chmod +x install.sh ```

## Using the tool

``` ./recon.sh ```
``` [+]Domain (ex: google.com): hackerone.com ```
